# Simple-Arduino-Brewing
Using an Arduino sketch to control a BIAB system, with minimal hardware and no coding experience required.

  This sketch uses an Arduino, a few simple inexpensive components and a serial port connection (any computer) to control a single vessel electric home brewery.  This setup would be best for those who BIAB.  

### Aim
- No coding or coding knowledge required
- Minimal hardware
- A good project for those who want to learn about electronics and coding in general.  Heavily commented code with clear explanations about connecting hardware.
- Good documentation.  
- Brewing good beer.

### Hardware
1.  Arduino
2.  Dallas DS18B20 Temp Sensor
3.  Solderless breadboard and jumper wires or a protoboard to solder everything
4.  5mm LED and resistor  (Try a 680 ohm or something close for the resistor)
5.  A way to connect the wires to the bread board, 2 pin screw terminal blocks, aligator clips, whatever works or you have laying around.
6.  4.7k ohm resistor (pullup resistor for the temp sensors)

  This hardware list only covers what you'll need for the electronic control, the 220v stuff (like an SSR, heating element etc etc) are not included in the list.  You're on your own for that.  There are many resources online to learn about those things though.  A basic setup would include something like a box or panel to mount everything in, an SSR, 220V LED indiator light, electrical wire and various grommets and plugs.  Your heating element will need some waterproof surrounding where the electrical connection is, and for your temp sensor you may wish to use a thermowell.  Again, you're on your own for this!  These are things that every electric brewing setup requires, at a minimum.
